I know getting the vital signs concepts populated correctly in the OMOP measurement table is still on BlueTree’s to-do list.

But in case it’s helpful for you to plan these future search facets in Leaf, I’m sending you the vital signs mapping file on which Joe and I collaborated.

There are 19 different standard concept_id values.  Each one also has a unit of measure (UOM), so you’ll see those in the file as well with mapping_type = MAPS_TO_UNIT.

BTW, the layout of this spreadsheet matches our new concept mapping import table:  src.usagi.usagi_mapping
