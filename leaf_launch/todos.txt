conditions:
    X run additional_scripts/large_files/icd10.sql to create temp UMLS_ICD10 table
    X Map ICD-10-CM → SNOMED in temp table, using Athena's reference data
    X find 'Epic diagnosis ID' records in src: caboodle.DiagnosisDim.DiagnosisEpicId is Epic Id
    X Map 1-to-1 'Epic diagnosis ID' → ICD-10-CM in temp table, using our Epic concept tables in src
    X add WHERE tbl._HasSourceClarity = 1 and tbl._IsDeleted = 0 where available
    get select access to omop for me
    replace automated mappings that conflict with the ones Sharon has mapped by hand
    properly populate SOURCES
    have conditions.sql generate a concept_map_for_loading table with
        ICD-10-CM → SNOMED mappings for omop.concept_relationship
    test and run leaf_icd10.sql
measurements (labs):
    Find relationships between "Epic lab code" & LOINC codes in sema4
    Sharon looking for LabComponentDim, LabComponentResultFact
procedures:
    find Epic code → CPT4 mappings in src
    Review Tim's email on "Additional tables desired in src.caboodle"
drugs:
    learn how to map ‘EPIC ERX .1’ source concepts in drug_exposure to RxNorm (Q to Sharon on 7/28)
    BlueTree extract Caboodle’s MedicationCodeDim table, which maps EPIC ERX .1 in MedicationDim to NDC or RxNorm codes, to [src]
training & helping users:
    Send presentation RE Leaf docs and help to CM

later:
    reload UMLS_ICD10 with most recent hierarchical ICD10 relationships in the UMLS MRHIER.RRF table
    perhaps make views on all Caboodle tables that hide non-Clarity data
    resources that would help me create and verify queries, such as: the schemas for Caboodle tables, especially with foreign key constraints and/or semantic comments; other documentation about Caboodle’s data at the table and field level.
    determine degree of overlap between SurgicalProcedureEventFact and ProcedureEventFact; see Tim's email on "Additional tables desired in src.caboodle"
    eliminate duplication between leaf_launch/conditions/conditions.sql and other scripts in leaf_launch/conditions
