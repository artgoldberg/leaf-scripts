conditions:
    X run additional_scripts/large_files/icd10.sql to create temp UMLS_ICD10 table
    X Map ICD-10-CM → SNOMED in temp table, using Athena's reference data
    X find 'Epic diagnosis ID' records in src: caboodle.DiagnosisDim.DiagnosisEpicId is Epic Id
    X Map 1-to-1 'Epic diagnosis ID' → ICD-10-CM in temp table, using our Epic concept tables in src
    X add WHERE tbl._HasSourceClarity = 1 and tbl._IsDeleted = 0 where available
    X get select access to omop for me
    X replace automated mappings that conflict with the ones Sharon has mapped by hand
    X properly populate SOURCES
    validate the mappings:
        X no NULLs in EPIC EDG .1, ICD10, or SNOMED, so all used EDG .1 can be fully mapped
        X all EPIC EDG .1 → SNOMED are 1-to-1, so condition_concept_id can be unambiguously initialized
    X count the unique ICD10 codes in the diagnosis_map
    X check with Nic on size of ICD10 tree
    x make a concept_map_for_loading table with ICD-10-CM → SNOMED mappings for BlueTree
    x obtain the 1-to-many manual mappings
    x rename diagnosis_map -> conditions_map
    x put Algorithms in Confluence
    x login to Confluence
    x document the mappings
    x Consult with Sharon RE EPIC EDG .1 → ICD10 → SNOMED mappings
    examine # unique ICD10s when not filtering on 'active' codes
    test and run leaf_icd10.sql
    perhaps create general purpose stored procedure that could be used for conditions.sql & other domains
    use the manual mappings in src.usagi.mapping_import
    modify conditions.sql and CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP so conditions.sql can always identify manual mappings
x analyze mapping_import:
    x rows that are all NULL in either all source or all target concepts
    x rows that match the concept relationships I find in omop.cdm
procedures:
    find Epic code → CPT4 mappings in src
    Review Tim's email on "Additional tables desired in src.caboodle"
other:
    Share Leaf_ideas.txt with Nic
    transition to AD authorization for Leaf service account
measurements (labs):
    Find relationships between "Epic lab code" & LOINC codes in sema4
    Sharon looking for LabComponentDim, LabComponentResultFact
drugs:
    learn how to map ‘EPIC ERX .1’ source concepts in drug_exposure to RxNorm (Q to Sharon on 7/28)
    BlueTree extract Caboodle’s MedicationCodeDim table, which maps EPIC ERX .1 in MedicationDim to NDC or RxNorm codes, to [src]
other domains:
    try Leaf's functionality for Vitals and Demographics again, and report to Tim
training & helping users:
    Send presentation RE Leaf docs and help to CM
    Create draft presentation & share with Sharon and Laura
    Get Jira service desk setup, and configured
    get Leaf help email setup, and configured



later:
    will need to rerun conditions.sql as MSDW2 changes, because it only maps Epic codes that are actually used
    reload UMLS_ICD10 with most recent hierarchical ICD10 relationships in the UMLS MRHIER.RRF table
    perhaps make views on all Caboodle tables that hide non-Clarity data
    resources that would help me create and verify queries, such as: the schemas for Caboodle tables, especially with foreign key constraints and/or semantic comments; other documentation about Caboodle’s data at the table and field level.
    determine degree of overlap between SurgicalProcedureEventFact and ProcedureEventFact; see Tim's email on "Additional tables desired in src.caboodle"
    eliminate duplication between leaf_launch/conditions/conditions.sql and other scripts in leaf_launch/conditions
