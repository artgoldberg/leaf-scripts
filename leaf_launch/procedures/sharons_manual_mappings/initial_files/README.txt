Transformations to initial manual mapping files:
1. Insert initial column called 'Type' that distinguishes between 'surgical' and 'non-surgical' procedures
2. Standardize headings: see layout in "headings_conversions.xlsx".

Ideally, this would be automated using a Python or shell program, but it isn't worth my time now.
