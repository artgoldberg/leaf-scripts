-- Get 'Epic diagnosis ID' â†’ SNOMED mappings by Sharon from concept_relationship

-- Result is a set of CONCEPT_ID pairs, mapping an 'Epic diagnosis ID' to a SNOMED concept id, along with their CONCEPT_NAMEs to help review.


-- Approach: get records in CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP that map from 'EPIC EDG .1' to 'SNOMED'
